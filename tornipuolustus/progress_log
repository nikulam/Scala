11.3:
-Traits setup
-Basic tower
-Enemies

TODO:   Basic tower doesn't shoot a projectile.
Issues: Enemies might move faster diagonally. Tower firing cooldown counter missing.

Notes: No testing done.

Working hours: 5
On schedule.

24.3:
-No code changes

Notes: Been having a lot of fun trying to get Processing to work with scala in Eclipse. (Using Processing to draw the UI... or trying to)
Tried many sample projects combining Scala and Processing to get working from the internet. No luck. 
I've been able to import Processing to said projects, been able to add it to the build path, but it seems like
the projects can't find the methods.

Working hours: 10
Falling behind due to not being able to get Processing working.

8.4:
-Great progress
-Processing correctly draws: map, enemies, towers, player info, tower list
-Tower placing implemented
-Towers correctly fire at enemies
-Unique tower cooldowns (editable)
-Per wave enemy spawning cooldowns (editable)
-Maps are easy to create: only have to give a sequence of positions and the game will draw them automatically and the enemies will follow.

TODO: Text file reading for waves and levels. Level creator/editor. Maybe we'll even have sounds... :p
Issues: Towers can be placed on path.

Notes: Towers still fire by hitscan. Enemies move correctly, towers fire correctly (so far) and give money on hit. 

8.4: (another update)
-Different colored enemies
-Towers fire projectiles which deal editable amounts of damage and can pierce multiple enemies
-Implemented waves.txt which the game uses to spawn waves:
	first line contains W (as in wave) and the wave number (not really used in code)
	second line contains "cooldown:xx" where xx is the amount of ticks in between spawns
	third+ lines contain "x:y" where x is the health of the enemy and y is the amount. These go in order, meaning first line's enemies are spawned first, then the second...
	
TODO: A lot of commenting. Level creator/editor
Issues: Towers can be placed on path. The game crashes when trying to start a new wave after the last one is finished.

Total hours ~25	


14.4:
-Towers cannot be placed in invalid spots: on the path or on top of other towers.
-2 new towers: tack shooter and bomb tower
-Displays tower info when hovering over the towers in the buy menu
-Added a few animations: bloon pop, explosion (just circles with different colors, no real graphics)
-Tweaked projectile hitting to allow for piercing projectiles to actually hit enemies correctly

TODO: Level creator
Issues: Game crashes when trying to start a wave past the final

Total hours 40
